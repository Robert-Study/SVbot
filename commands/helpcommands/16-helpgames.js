Saves can be earned at checkpoint (50, 101, 500 and 1001). Count wrong? A save will kick in and you can keep on counting, or start again at 1 when the saves have run out.\n\n__Simon Says__\nSimon will at random times post a message like "Simon says: pineapple" -> if you reply with pineapple you get a point. Tho when simon **asks** for something you should not reply.\n\n__StarBar__\nAt the StarBar the levels increase with the hour (at 0:00), claiming a level means resetting the bar to 0. Try to claim the highest level (5 stars) possible.');
